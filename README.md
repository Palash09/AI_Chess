# AI_Chess
This is a javascript based AI incorporated chess game.

The game is implemented using a GUI which was built using chess.js and chessboard.js libraries. For implementing the algorithm
for chess moves, I have used minimax algorithm which helps AI in deciding the best possible moves based on the score given to 
each piece of the chess board.

Furthermore, the minimax algorithm was improved by using alpha-beta pruning algorithm. The chessboard styling and piece placement 
was built using chess.js and chessboard.js which is then combined with the javascript algorithm built for piece move making,
and other relevant decisions.
